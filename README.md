## Overview

### The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this dashboard and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Switch between viewing Daily, Weekly, and Monthly stats

## My process

  - Built by following a design picture.
  - Built with HTML Semantic Elements.
  - Checked design and requirements after building.
  - My efforts + Google + chatGPT.
  - Used google lighthouse.

    
### Continued development

  With the help of GROK AI I found two screen readers(NVDA and VoiceOver). In future I will explore how to check/test accessibility.

## Acknowledgments

I have used Google and chatGPT for different things. I believe it's fine to use Google or chatGPT for a coding concept or code that we completely don't know. There are two good possibilites to use chatGPT and Google for code or coding concepts.
 - Completely don't aware then explore, find, ask.
 - Have knowledge then solve a problem and ask for review.
